# Predicting-Ad-Clicks-Based-on-Context-of-Ads
The objective is to predict whether an individual (buyer or a seller) will click on an ad based on the context of the ad and the behavior of the individual. We will also attempt to answer a few other questions based on the data such as targeted advertising and user profiling.

This is a term project in my class AIT 690 - Social Media Analytics. I along with two other colleagues developed this project in Fall 2016.

To review our findings please check the report titled Predicting Clicks Based on Context of Ads.pdf. Do not refrain to shoot back at us for any questions/ concerns.
